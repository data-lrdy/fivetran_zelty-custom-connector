# Zelty API Data Retrieval
This repository contains Python code that uses the requests library to retrieve data from the Zelty API endpoint. The API returns JSON data which is then used to extract relevant information and create structured data.

##Installation
To use the code, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Then, install the necessary dependencies:
```


pip install requests
Usage
The main code of this repository can be found in the zelty_api.py file. This file contains the function get_data(table, headers), which retrieves data for a given table from the Zelty API endpoint. The function takes two parameters:

table: a string that specifies the name of the table to retrieve data from.
headers: a dictionary that contains the necessary authorization headers to access the API endpoint.
The get_data function uses a GET request to retrieve data from the API endpoint, and returns the data in JSON format.

There is also a function called get_menus(headers) which is used to retrieve menu data from the API endpoint. This function takes only the headers parameter, and retrieves data from the "menus" table.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the get_data function to retrieve data from the "users" table:

python
Copy code
import requests
from zelty_api import get_data

headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
users_data = get_data("users", headers)
This will retrieve data for all users from the API endpoint, and return the data in JSON format.
